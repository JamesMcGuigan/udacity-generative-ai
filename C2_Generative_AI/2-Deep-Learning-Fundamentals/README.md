### TL;DR Table of Key Differences

| **Name** | **Type** | **Use Case** | **Learning** | **Layer Type** | **Output** | **Activation** |
|----------|----------|--------------|--------------|----------------|------------|----------------|
| `BernoulliRBM` | Unsupervised | Feature learning, generative models | Unsupervised (Contrastive Divergence) | One hidden layer | Binary activations | Logistic (sigmoid) |
| `MLPClassifier` | Supervised | Classification | Supervised (Backpropagation) | Multi-layer (deep) | Probabilities / Class labels | ReLU / tanh / logistic |
| `MLPRegressor` | Supervised | Regression | Supervised (Backpropagation) | Multi-layer (deep) | Continuous values | ReLU / tanh / logistic |

## 🔮 1. `BernoulliRBM`: The Feature-Huffing Goblin Monk
### Bernoulli Restricted Boltzmann Machine

#### 🧠 What is it?
An **unsupervised generative neural net** with just two layers:
- **Visible layer** (inputs, e.g. pixels)
- **Hidden layer** (latent features, like little pixel-fetish gremlins)

All neurons are **binary-valued** (hence *Bernoulli*), and it **learns probability distributions** over your input data.

#### 🛠️ Use Case
- Feature extraction / pretraining for supervised networks
- Denoising or modeling binary inputs (like MNIST digits)
- Early deep learning used these stacked (Deep Belief Networks)

#### 🔄 How it learns
- Trained with **Contrastive Divergence** (CD-k) — a quirky Monte Carlo-ish trick that approximates the gradient.
- Learns to model **P(data)**, not class labels.

#### 🎯 Outputs
- Probabilistic binary hidden features. Can also *reconstruct* input data.

#### 😅 Limitations
- Training is unstable and finicky
- Mostly a historical relic now; replaced by VAEs, GANs, Transformers

## 🧱 2. `MLPClassifier`: The Psychic Octopus That Classifies
### Multi-layer Perceptron Classifier

#### 🧠 What is it?
A **fully connected feedforward neural net** trained with **supervised learning**. It has:
- Input layer
- One or more **hidden layers** (you choose how many)
- Output layer for classification (e.g., softmax)

#### 🛠️ Use Case
- Classification tasks: digits, text categories, iris flowers, cult members
- Handles non-linearity via multiple layers and activation functions

#### 🔄 How it learns
- Classic **backpropagation** + **stochastic gradient descent** (or Adam, LBFGS)
- Loss function = Cross-entropy for classification

#### ⚙️ Output
- Class probabilities or discrete class labels

#### 🧠 Activations
- Default hidden: `ReLU`
- Output: `softmax` or `logistic`, depending on task (binary vs multiclass)

---

## 📈 3. `MLPRegressor`: The Sibling Who Predicts Stock Prices (or Chaos)
### Multi-layer Perceptron Regressor

#### 🧠 What is it?
**Same underlying architecture** as `MLPClassifier`, but designed for **continuous outputs**.

#### 🛠️ Use Case
- Predicting real-valued functions: temperature, prices, curve fitting
- Nonlinear regression problems

#### 🔄 How it learns
- Backpropagation again
- Loss function: **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** or similar regression loss

#### ⚙️ Output
- Single float or a vector of continuous numbers

#### 🧠 Activations
- Hidden: `ReLU`, `tanh`, etc.
- Output: Linear (by default) — returns real values

## 🧠 Summary With Metaphors

| Module | Brain Analogy | Memelord Version |
|--------|---------------|------------------|
| `BernoulliRBM` | 🧙 Wizard that dreams in bits and learns patterns in the shadows | "I do not know what this is, but I shall hallucinate its essence repeatedly until I do." |
| `MLPClassifier` | 🎯 Brain that labels objects after training on examples | "This is a duck. That is a Discordian banana. I have seen enough ducks to know a duck." |
| `MLPRegressor` | 📈 Brain that guesses numbers based on patterns | "Based on this trend, your chaos coefficient will hit 42.69 by Tuesday." |

---

### Bonus Tips (Discordian Flavor):
- `BernoulliRBM` is **only good for binary features**. You need to binarize your input.
- You can **stack RBMs and feed into an MLP** (very old-school deep learning).
- For modern workflows, MLPs are more useful — `RBM` is more of a collector's item.
