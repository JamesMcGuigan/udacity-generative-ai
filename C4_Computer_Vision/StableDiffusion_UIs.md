## Fooocus
- https://github.com/lllyasviel/Fooocus

If you're brand new, I'd recommend Fooocus.
It's got a very clean, easy-to-use interface and does some internal 
quality enhancements so your images should generally look better without
needing a lot of tinkering.  It's also one of the best (possibly best) 
at Inpainting.
  

## A1111

As you get more comfortable and start wanting more control/more advanced features, I'd recommend Automatic1111 or Invoke.
A1111 has tons of features and plugins, and is widely used, so there's
plenty of tutorials.  It's not as polished as Fooocus though.  Invoke 
is a good middle-ground - it's got a great interface and more features 
and control than Fooocus, but not to quite the same degree as A1111.  
Like Fooocus, it's also great at Inpainting.
  

## ComfyUI
- https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI

is the most powerful, but it's got a steep learning curve.  It gives 
you much more direct control over the entire render pipeline, so you can
do lots of cool stuff if you're willing to dive in and spend a lot of 
time tweaking things.  It's also the UI which tends to get the most 
cutting-edge features first.
  
## SD Next

Another option which I'm not really familiar with is SD.Next.
  
## Stability Matrix
- https://github.com/LykosAI/StabilityMatrix

You might want to consider installing Stability Matrix.  It's a manager which will help you install multiple UIs setting up a shared models folder.
